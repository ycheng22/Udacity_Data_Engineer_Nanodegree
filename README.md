# Udacity_Data_Engineer_Nanodegree

This is a course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027).


## Part 1: Welcome to the Nanodegree Program 

## Part 2: Data Modeling 

**Content**: 

- Learning SQL by PostgreSQL database. Learning NoSQL by Apache Cassandra.
    
- Project 1a: Data Modeling with Postgres. Modeling user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app.
    
- Project 1b: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra. Modeling event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app.

`Trick`: I use Windows 10, so installing Apache Cassandra could be tricky. I tried on my laptop and desktop. I installed it successfully on my laptop.

## Part 3: Cloud Data Warehouses 

**Content**: 

- Learning data warehouse on AWS.
    
- Project: Data Warehouse. Extracting data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team. 
    
`Trick`: All functions needed in this course come with free trial on AWS.

## Part 4: Data Lakes with Spark 

**Content**: 

- Learning Spark with AWS.
    
- Project: Data Lake. Building a data lake and an ETL pipeline in Spark that loads data from S3, processes the data into analytics tables, and loads them back into S3. 
    
`Trick`: I installed PySpark on windows 10. PySpark can work, but will pop up warning or wrong message. I switched to Google Colab, which worked withoug pain.

## Part 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow 

**Content**: 

- Learning data piplines on Apache Airflow.
    
- Project: Data Pipelines. Creating and automating a set of data pipelines with Airflow, monitoring and debugging production pipelines.

## Part 6: Capstone Project
